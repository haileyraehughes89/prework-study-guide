## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for completing this project was to complete the prework expectations. In addition to this I wanted to learn as much as possible to prepare myself for the more complicated work to come. I built the project in order to work with the fundamentals of coding. More importantly, I believe, I was able to use terminal to communicate between VS code and github. I ran into issues at the start connect github to terminal and VS code, but I was determined to troubleshoot the issue on my own. In doiing so I was also able to practice taking notes on code that was not functioning. This assignment solves the problem of being unprepared for the first class. I learned how to code on my personal laptop using terminal, VS code and github. I learned the basics of project communication so that tasks can be assigned, monitored, edited and then merged into the larger project. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I learned how to imbed CSS and Javascript into an HTML document.
